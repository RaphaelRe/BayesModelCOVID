This repo contains 4 directories:
* `application`
* `data `
- `model`
* `simulation_study`


## application
Contains the files to fit the model to the real data:
* `fit_model_europe.py`: Main file to run the model on 20 European countries
* `prepare_data.R`: Script to build the main data frame for the application. Downloads data, defines NPIs and brings everything together
* `estimate_new_mutants.R`: File which was used to estimate the prevalence of the variants of concern
* `calculate_weighted_ifr.R`: File which was used to calculate $\pi^{D}$


## data
Folder contains the used data. These are:
- All time-shifting distributions
- The IFR as generated by `calculate_weighted_ifr.R`
- prevalence of variants of concern as calculated by `estimate_new_mutants.R`
- data for the application (generated by `prepare_data.R`) 
- subfolder `simulated_data` with 20 simulated datasets generated by`simulate_data_dynamic.R`


## model
The MCMC sampler which is used in the application and simulation study.


## simulation_study
Contains all files for the simulation study:
* `fit_model_simulation_study.py`: Main fail to fit the model to the simulation study
* `simulate_data_dynamic.R`: Script to simulate the data for the simulation study
